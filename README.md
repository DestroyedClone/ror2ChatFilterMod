## Chat Filter Mod

[![github issues/request link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/github_link.webp)](https://github.com/DestroyedClone/ror2ChatFilterMod/issues) [![discord invite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/discord_link.webp)](https://discord.gg/DpHu3qXMHK)

Adds a bunch of config settings to toggle pickup messages, shrine activations, etc.

Post on the github if there's any false positives or any tokens you want added. Or if there's any issues... that's what it's for after all.

Some stuff here is untested, and they'll be marked on this readme. Usually due to it being a multiplayer mod. Other stuff is Rushed just so the mod can get released, so it may not even work at all for that modcompat!

Please take note that if configs aren't shared across users then what you may see is different from what someone else sees, resulting in potential miscommunication. An example below:
| Player A | Player B |
|--|--|
| B: Start tele? <sup>(offscreen+unseen)</sup><br>B has picked up<br>B has picked up<br>B has picked up<br>B has picked up<br>B: Gonna answer???| B: Start tele?<br>B: Gonna answer??? |
